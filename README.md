# Cryptography Algorithms Implementation

A small, educational Python project with implementations of common cryptography primitives:
- AES (symmetric encryption with CBC + PKCS7 padding)
- RSA (asymmetric encryption with PKCS1_OAEP)
- Hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512)

This repository is designed for learning and demonstration. It includes:
- `src/` — implementation code
- `examples/` — small scripts showing how to use the library
- `tests/` — pytest unit tests
- `docs/` — documentation and screenshots placeholders
- `outputs/` — example output files and logs

## Requirements

Run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the example scripts:

bash
Copy code
python examples/demo_aes.py
python examples/demo_rsa.py
python examples/demo_hashing.py
Run tests:

bash
Copy code
pytest -q
