# Project Overview

This small project implements basic cryptographic algorithms for learning purposes.

Goals:
- Teach how AES symmetric encryption works (CBC mode + padding)
- Teach how RSA asymmetric encryption works (key pair, encrypt/decrypt)
- Provide hashing utilities (MD5, SHA-256, SHA-512)
- Provide simple file utilities (read/write, directories, logging)
- Provide example scripts and tests to verify correctness

This project is educational: do not use it as-is in high-security production environments without auditing and using established libraries/configuration and secure key handling procedures.
